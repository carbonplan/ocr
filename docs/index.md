# OCR documentation

This documentation is organized into four complementary sections to help contributors and users quickly find the right kind of information:

- Tutorials — learning-oriented, step-by-step examples for common tasks.
- How-to guides — task-oriented instructions to accomplish a single goal (install, configure, run).
- Technical references — API-level and configuration references for developers.
- Explanations — conceptual and methods discussion that explain how the system works.

Where to start:

- Getting started / How-to:

  - [Installation](how-to/installation.md) — install and configure OCR locally (pixi and pip options).

- Tutorials:

  - [Data Pipeline](tutorials/data-pipeline.md) — step-by-step tutorial: process a region locally and on Coiled.

- Technical reference:

  - [API](reference/api.md) — generated API reference for main modules.
  - [Project Structure](reference/project-structure.md) — file layout and where to find code and data.

- Explanations / Methods:

  - [Input Datasets](explanations/input-datasets.md) — input data sources and how they are ingested.
  - [Fire Risk](explanations/fire-risk.md) — high-level description of the fire risk calculation method.

Follow the Getting Started How-to first to set up your environment, then try the tutorial to run a small end-to-end example.
