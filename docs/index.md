# OCR documentation

This documentation is organized into four complementary sections to help contributors and users quickly find the right kind of information:

- Tutorials: learning-oriented, step-by-step examples for common tasks.
- How-to guides: task-oriented instructions to accomplish a single goal (install, configure, run).
- Technical references: API-level and configuration references for developers.
- Methods: conceptual and methods discussion that explain how the system works.

Follow the Getting Started How-to first to set up your environment, then try the tutorial to run a small end-to-end example.
