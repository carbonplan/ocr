# API reference

This page hosts the auto-generated API reference for the package. The reference is produced by `mkdocstrings` (or similar) during docs build and will include docstrings from the package modules.

If you update public functions or classes, add or improve docstrings so the generated docs are informative.

Primary modules included here (examples):

::: ocr.datasets

::: ocr.utils

::: ocr.risks.fire

Regenerating docs locally

1. Ensure the package is importable (use `pixi shell` or `pip install -e .`).
2. Run the docs build (mkdocs) locally to render the API reference:

```bash
pixi run docs-serve
# or the project-specific command that starts mkdocs locally
```
